# poker-game-with-ai:
### NOTES/UPDATES: 
The project is in its early stages and not yet complete. The game is now (hopefuly) bug free or at least all obvious bugs 
in the game logic have been removed and users came now play every street without worry of a crash or incorrect payouts. 
Currrently there is no way in game for players to "add on" chips, drop out of the game,
add players, or automatically kick out players with no chips. 
More testing should also be done to ensure everything is working properly in edge cases which i tried to accomidate for 
especually cases where a player in one of the blinds blind cannot post the amount needed to be paid in full. 
Please report any bugs found. Much of the game can probably be cleaned up and made more efficient and hopefuly this will 
continue to improve as the project grows. Currently working on the implimentation of the actual poker solver/bot. 
I am also attempting to build the final version as a website so if you are interested in this or interested in contributing 
to the project or would like to help please contact me at: parkerhagmaier@gmail.com.
The c++ version of the actual poker game will be posted shortly.

## SUMMARY:
Creating a console poker game that allows user to practice/ practice against a bot and or other human players.
Currently only the basic game is functional and the 'bot' implimentation is not yet finished.
Hopefuly pure solver functionality will also be added so users can just see what the bot thinks is the optimal strategy 
in each particular situation. 
The end goal is to have this as a website.

## TO-DO:
1. More testing
2. Create solver. 
3. Create bot that uses the solver in order to play against human player
4. rewrite in c++
