# poker-game-with-ai:
### NOTES/UPDATES: 
Currently the Python version still has a few small bugs and a couple tweaks need to be made in
order to assure that it works as expected. This should be fixed tomorow. 
The c++ version is mostly finished but most likley buggy and has problems since it has not 
been tested at all. Since it is basically a quick copy of the python code the logic should
be fine but there is most likley problems in the code and both the game looe and main
function need to be added. More error testing and play throughs need to be done on both.
Additionally both need to add fuctionaility to allow players to drop out of the game and add money
to the stack since as of now this is not possible. 
Once both versions of the code are totally complete we will get to work on the web version of the
program so hopefuly that will be up and running by the end of the month if anyone is still
following or cares about the project
## SUMMARY:
Creating a console poker game that allows user to practice/ practice against a bot
and or other human players.
Currently only the basic game is functional and the 'bot' implimentation is not yet finished.
Hopefuly pure solver functionality will also be added so users can just see what the bot
thinks is the optimal strategy in each particular situation. 
The end goal is to have this as a website.
currently an early (unfinished) version of the python and c++ game are uploaded
without bot functionality. Cpp version is very unfinished and not yet playable. 

## TO-DO:
1. More testing
2. Add comments. 
3. Improve readme and documentation for both versions.
4. Create solver. 
5. Create bot that uses the solver in order to play against human player
