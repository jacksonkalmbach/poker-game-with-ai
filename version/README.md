### NOTEs/UPDATED: 
The project is in its early stages and not yet complete. The game is now relativley bug free or at least all obvious bugs in the game logic have been removed and users came now play every street without worry of a crash or incorrect payouts. Still need to add the gameloop to the game class, add a way for players to "add on" chips, drop out of the game, add a player without money out of the game. More testing should also be done to ensure everything is working properly especially edge cases which i tried to accomidate for like ablind not being able to post in full. Some cash games don't allow this but I decided to allow for it. Feel free to report bugs or inform me. Much of the game can probably be cleaned up and made more efficient not to mention the game logic particularly the payments could be done better. Visuals (ASCI Visuals) will be added tomorrow along with a cleaned up final version of the python code. I will then try to impliment a bot and a bot class so that a user can play against it. I will also impliment pure solver functionality that I hope will not be too terrible. I am also attempting to build the final version as a website so if you are interested in this or interested in this project or would like to help please contact me at: parkerhagmaier@gmail.com

## SUMMARY:
Creating a console poker game that you can practice against by playing against a bot
Not finished yet in preliminary stages. 
The goal is to create a poker game you can play in terminal and then essentially create a fairly decent poker solver that a player can chose to play against as an adversary to practice against. Another goal is just to have the solver as a seperate thing all together so you can run poker sims and see the optimal course of action to take. If all that goes well I may try to make it a website depending on how well this goes.

## TO-DO:
1. More testing
2. Add visuals (ASCI and possibly GUI although i'm trying to turn this into a website eventually)
3. Create solver. 
4. Create bot to play as solver
5. rewrite in c++
